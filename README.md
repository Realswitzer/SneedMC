# Help & Support

Feel free to create an issue if you need help. However, you might find it easier to ask in the Discord server.

# Development

If you want to contribute to SneedMC you might find it useful to join our Discord Server or Matrix Space.

## Building

If you want to build SneedMC yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

## Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:

- Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
- Prefer readability over dogma.
- Keep to the existing formatting.
- Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
- Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.

## Translations

The translation effort for SneedMC is hosted on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/polymc/polymc/) and information about translating SneedMC is available at https://github.com/PolyMC/Translations
